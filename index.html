                    <p>
                        In my final darkened hour <br>
                        You will come for me <br>

                    <p>
                        When the lights are burning out <br>
                        You will guide me home <br>
                        Away from blind confusing time <br>
                        Straight back home to me

                    <h2>The Pavilion Bird</h2>
                    <p>
                        Never I’ll be <br>
                        So entirely free <br>
                        So completely untied to the ground <br>
                        As the day when I heard <br>
                        The pavilion bird <br>
                        Make her strange and beautiful sound
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I laid me down <br>
                        By the Traveller’s Pond <br>
                        And I opened my ears and my heart <br>
                        And I let that call <br>
                        Take a hold of my all <br>
                        With its singing work of art
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A sound so pure <br>
                        Deeper still <br>
                        Away from life <br>
                        Away from will 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now whenever I see <br>
                        A pavilion tree <br>
                        I put my ear to the sky <br>
                        But there’s never a sound <br>
                        No it can’t be found <br>
                        And you know the reason why
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The day is old <br>
                        The sun is cold <br>
                        Since we no longer speak <br>
                        No birds will sing <br>
                        No bells will ring <br>
                        Since we no longer speak
                    </p>

                    <h2>1981-</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s a walk in the sunniest of parks <br>
                        It’s your home <br> 
                        It’s your family <br>
                        Grow up in the grace of your mom <br>
                        Stepping outside <br>
                        Carrying the world in your hands <br>
                        As you smile with your friends <br>
                        As you laugh as you dance <br> 
                        As the music is playing <br>
                        Always music is playing <br>
                        In your ears in your head in your bones <br>
                        And you take on it <br>
                        And you become a part of it <br>
                        And it lingers forever on in your heart <br>
                        It’s art or at least you want it to be <br>
                        But it’s big and it’s vast <br>
                        And it’s getting hard to grasp <br>
                        Where it starts and where it ends <br>
                        And if it can make any sense <br>
                        To dedicate your life to singing <br>
                        You say nothing is real anyways <br>
                        Might as well keep on doing <br>
                        What makes you feel good inside
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So there you go <br>
                        Rhyming in the countryside of life <br>
                        Where time is moving slow <br>
                        But not in your head <br>
                        Where things are spinning <br>
                        Sometimes out of control <br>
                        Like what if I’m not any good <br> 
                        What if none of these dreams will come true <br>
                        What should I do <br>
                        And what do they think about me <br>
                        What if all I am doing is doing it wrong <br>
                        What if there is no reward <br> 
                        What if all you will find is a stone <br>
                        What if I’m alone <br>
                        And so it goes <br>
                        And sometimes you stare in the mirror <br>
                        But you don’t know what you see <br>
                        How can I be sure that guy is really me <br>
                        Reality dissolves <br>
                        Oh how easy you can make <br>
                        Reality dissolve
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So here you are <br>
                        Not that old but far from forever young <br>
                        Little ones around your feet <br>
                        Diamonds and gold around your feet <br>
                        Seasons pass weather change <br>
                        Friends appear some remain <br>
                        It’s all a play <br>
                        Who’s in it <br> 
                        You don’t know <br> 
                        It’s not like your in control <br>
                        Just trying to get your lines right <br>
                        Trying to catch some limelight <br>
                        Pandemic hits war strikes <br>
                        Nature collapses your mother dies <br>
                        And through it all you’re OK <br>
                        Mostly OK <br>
                        Walking about carrying the world in your hands <br>
                        As you smile with your friends <br>
                        As you laugh as you dance <br> 
                        As the music is playing <br>
                        Always music is playing <br>
                        In your ears in your head in your bones <br>
